The license is under Google's Development Project (Maps(R)).

9. License Requirements. Google's licenses above are subject to your adherence to the following requirements:

9.1 Free, Public Accessibility to Your Maps API Implementation.

9.1.1 General Rules.

(a) Free Access (No Fees). Your Maps API Implementation must be generally accessible to users without charge and must not require a fee-based subscription or other fee-based restricted access. This rule applies to Your Content and any other content in your Maps API Implementation, whether Your Content or the other content is in existence now or is added later.

(b) Public Access (No Firewall). Your Maps API implementation must not operate (i) only behind a firewall; or (ii) only on an internal network (except during the development and testing phase); or (iii) in a closed community (for example, through invitation-only access).

9.1.2 Exceptions.

(a) Enterprise Agreement with Google. The rules in Section 9.1.1 (Free Access, Public Access) do not apply if you have entered into a separate written agreement with Google (such as a Google Enterprise agreement) or obtained Google's written permission.

(b) Mobile Applications.
(i) The rule in Section 9.1.1(a) (Free Access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation is used in a mobile application that is sold for a fee through an online store and is downloadable to a mobile device that can access the online store. 

(ii) The rule in Section 9.1.1(b) (Public Access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation is an Android application that uses the Google Maps Android API. (However, the rule in Section 9.1.1(b) (Public Access) will continue to apply if your Maps API Implementation is an Android application that uses any other Maps APIs, unless the Maps API Implementation qualifies for the exception in Section 9.1.2(a) (Enterprise Agreement with Google).)


9.1.3 Examples.

(a) You can require users to log in to your Maps API Implementation if you do not require users to pay a fee.

(b) You can charge a fee for your Maps API Implementation if it is an Android application downloadable to mobile devices from the Google Play Store.

(c) If you are a consultant who creates or hosts Maps API Implementations for third party customers, you may charge such customers a fee for your consulting or hosting services (but not for the Maps API Implementations themselves, except as permitted under Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions)).

9.2 Reporting. You must implement those reporting mechanisms that Google has set forth and may update from time to time in these Terms and in the Maps APIs Documentation.

9.3 End User Terms and Privacy Policy. If you develop a Maps API Implementation for use by other users, you must:

(a) display to the users of your Maps API Implementation the link to Google's Terms of Use as presented through the Service or described in the Maps APIs Documentation;

(b) explicitly state in your Maps API Implementation's terms of use that, by using your Maps API Implementation, your users are agreeing to be bound by Google's Terms of Use; and

(c) protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. 

(i) Your Privacy Policy. You must make publicly available, and must abide by, an appropriate privacy policy in your Maps API Implementation. In particular, if your Maps API Implementation enables you or any party to gain access to information about users of the Maps API(s), including but not limited to personally identifiable information (such as user names) or non-personally identifiable usage information (such as location), your privacy policy must describe your use and retention of this information.

(ii) Google's Privacy Policy. Your privacy policy must notify users that you are using the Maps API(s) and incorporate by reference the Google privacy policy by including a link to the Google privacy policy (currently http://www.google.com/policies/privacy.html), as amended by Google from time to time.

(iii) Cookies. As noted in the Documentation, certain Maps API(s) store and access cookies and other information on end users’ devices. If you use any of these Maps API(s) in your Maps API Implementation, then to the extent required by applicable law, you must provide end users with clear and comprehensive information about, and obtain the end users’ consent to, the use of such cookies.
